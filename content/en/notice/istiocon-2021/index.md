From February 22-25, Beijing time, the Istio community will be hosting the first IstioCon online, and registration is free to attend! I will be giving a lightning talk on Tuesday, February 23rd (the 12th day of the first month of the lunar calendar), as an evangelist and witness of Service Mesh technology in China, I will introduce the Service Mesh industry and community in China.

I am a member of the inaugural IstioCon organizing committee with Zhonghu Xu (Huawei) and Shaojun Ding (Intel), as well as the organizer of the China region. Considering Istio's large audience in China, we have arranged for Chinese presentations that are friendly to the Chinese time zone. There will be a total of 14 sharing sessions in Chinese, plus dozens more in English. The presentations will be in both lightning talk (10 minutes) and presentation (40 minutes) formats.
