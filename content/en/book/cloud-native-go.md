## Introduction

Cloud Native Go shows developers how to build large-scale cloud applications that, while meeting the strong needs of today's customers, can dynamically scale to handle data volumes, traffic, or users of almost any size.

Kevin Hoffman and Dan Nemeth describe modern cloud-native applications in detail, clarifying factors, rules, and habits related to rapid and reliable cloud-native development. They also introduced Go as a "simple and elegant" high-performance language, which is particularly suitable for cloud development.

In this book you will use Go to create microservices, use ReactJS and Flux to add front-end web components, and master advanced cloud-native technologies based on Go. Hoffman and Nemeth show how to use tools such as Wercker, Docker, and Dockerhub to build a continuous delivery pipeline; automatically push applications to the platform; and systematically monitor application performance in production.

- Learn "The Way of the Cloud": Why Developed Cloud Software Is Basically About Mindset and Rules
- Learn why using Go is ideal for cloud-native microservices development
- Plan for cloud applications that support continuous delivery and deployment
- Design the service ecosystem and then build them in a test-first manner
- Push ongoing work to the cloud
- Use event sources and CQRS mode to respond to large scale and high throughput
- Secure cloud-based web applications: the choice between what to do and what not to do
- Create a responsive cloud application with a third-party messaging vendor
- Build large-scale, cloud-friendly GUIs with React and Flux
- Monitor dynamic scaling, failover and fault tolerance in the cloud

The chapter introduction is as follows.

## About the author

**Kevin Hoffman** helps businesses bring their applications to the cloud by modernizing and building cloud-native services in many different languages. He started programming at the age of 10 and taught himself BASIC on the reassembled Commodore VIC-20. Since then, he has been obsessed with building software and has spent a lot of time learning languages, frameworks, and patterns. He has built a range of software from remote-control photography drones, bionic security systems, ultra-low-latency financial applications to mobile applications. He fell in love with the Go language when building custom components that needed to work with Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Kevin is the author of the popular Fantasy Book series ( [The Sigilord Chronicles](http://amzn.to/2fc8iES) ), and he is eagerly looking forward to finally combining his love of building software with his love of building fantasy worlds.

**Dan Nemeth** currently works as a consulting solutions architect at Pivotal, where he supports Pivotal Cloud Foundry. He has been developing software since Commodore 64, has been professionally coding since 1995, and has written CGI scripts for local ISPs using ANSIC. Since then, he has spent most of his career as an independent consultant providing solutions for everything from finance to the pharmaceutical industry, using a variety of languages and frameworks that were popular at the time. Dan recently accepted Go as his destination and passionately used it for all projects.

If you find that Dan is not at the computer, he is probably playing sailing or fly fishing in the waters near Annapolis.
