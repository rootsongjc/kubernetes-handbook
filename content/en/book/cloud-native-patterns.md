![Cloud Native Patterns translated by Jimmy Song](https://res.cloudinary.com/jimmysong/image/upload/v1596934111/images/cloud-native-patterns-jimmysong.jpg)

What exactly are we talking about when we discuss cloud native? I've been pondering this question over the years, and we may have different perspectives. Three years ago, I translated my first book on cloud native, and have been involved in the translation and creation of a series of cloud native works, as well as through participation in and observation of open source projects, communities, foundations, and application clouding in the cloud native space, I have come to the following conclusion: cloud native is a behavior and design philosophy, in essence, any behavior that can improve resource utilization and application delivery efficiency in the cloud or ways are cloud native. The history of cloud computing is a history of cloud-native biochemistry. Cloud native is the inevitable result of cloud computing adapting to the social division of labor, leaving system resources, underlying infrastructure, and application choreography to the cloud platform, and allowing developers to focus on business logic, which is exactly what cloud computing has been seeking for a long time. Cloud native applications, which seek to quickly build highly fault-tolerant and elastic distributed applications, the ultimate in R&D efficiency and a friendly go-live and maintenance experience, were born with the idea of cloud native, and they are inherently suited to be deployed in the cloud to maximize the dividends of cloud computing.

I had previously translated several books on the subject of cloud-native, including Kevin Hoffman, author of Cloud Native Go, and Josh Long, author of Cloud Native Java, both of whom are from Pivotal or have worked at Pivotal for many years, and when I came across this book, I was surprised to find that the author Cornelia Davis is also from the same company, and Pivotal is really the Whampoa Military Academy of Cloud Natives. The content of this book is different from the previous Cloud Natives books, with a different approach to the model, so I immediately contacted Zhang Chunyu, the editor of the Electronic Industry Press. Java, my second collaboration with him, is really impressive in terms of the precision and efficiency with which he translated the book, and we each translated half of the book.
Everyone is talking about cloud-native, but they don't know exactly how to implement it. This book lists 12 patterns for building cloud-native applications, focusing on the data, services, and interactions of cloud-native applications, i.e., application-level design patterns, which are interspersed throughout the chapters in Part 2 of the book.

I would also like to thank the [ServiceMesher community](https://www.servicemesher.com), members of the [Cloud Native Community](https://cloudnative.to), and volunteers for their contribution to the development of cloud native in China, your encouragement and support is the driving force behind the continuous efforts and exploration in the field of cloud native. There are inevitably some mistakes in the translation of this book, and we hope readers will correct them.
