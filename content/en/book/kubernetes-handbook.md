### Kubernetes Handbook——Kubernetes Chinese Guide/Cloud Native Application Architecture Practice Manual

This book started in March 2017. It records my journey of learning and using Kubernetes from scratch. It focuses on experience sharing and summary. At the same time, it also has related concept analysis. I hope to help everyone step less and pit. The detour will also guide everyone to pay attention to the Kubernetes ecological surroundings, such as microservices construction, DevOps, big data applications, Service Mesh, Cloud Native and other fields.

### Before the start

Before reading this book, I hope you have the following knowledge and prepared the following environment:

- Linux operating system principle
- Linux common commands
- Docker container principle and basic operations
- A computer with internet access, Mac / Windows / Linux
- Install Docker

### Book subject

The topics of this book are not limited to Kubernetes, but also include the following major topics:

- Cloud-native open source components
- Cloud-native applications and microservices architecture
- Kubernetes-based Service Mesh architecture
- Kubernetes and microservices combined practice

At the time of writing this book, all installed components, examples and operations are based on the **Kubernetes 1.6+** version. At the same time, we will pay close attention to Kubernetes version updates. As its version updates and upgrades, the Kubernetes version and examples in this book It will be updated accordingly.

**Note: The Service Mesh related content in this book is no longer maintained, please go to [istio-handbook](https://www.servicemesher.com/istio-handbook) to browse.**

### Quick start

If you want to learn Kubernetes and cloud-native application architecture but do not want to build and configure a cluster yourself from scratch, you can directly use the [kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster](https://github.com/rootsongjc/kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster) project to directly deploy a 3-node distributed cluster and other such as Heapster , EFK, Istio and other optional components, or use a more lightweight [cloud-native-sandbox](https://github.com/rootsongjc/cloud-native-sandbox) to run single-node Kubernetes, Istio and other components on a personal computer using Docker.
